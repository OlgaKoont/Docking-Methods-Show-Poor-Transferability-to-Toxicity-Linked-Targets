All protein structures were preprocessed using the Meeko framework to ensure consistent310
protonation states. Binding site parameters were then derived with LaBOX. For Estrogen receptor311
(1ERE), Androgen receptor (4K7A), and CYP2D6 (4WNV), the docking boxes were defined from312
the co-crystallized ligand, providing reliable reference pockets. In contrast, CYP3A4 (1TQN) was313
used in its apo form, where the ligand-binding cavity is large and flexible; here, cavity detection was314
applied to approximate the catalytic site without a priori bias toward a single binding mode
