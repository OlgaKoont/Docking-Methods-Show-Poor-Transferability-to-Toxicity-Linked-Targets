To ensure data quality and comparability across targets, the ligand sets extracted from ChEMBL were317
subjected to a series of preprocessing steps. Specifically, we removed duplicate entries, ligands with318
molecular weight exceeding 500 Da, records with non-nanomolar activity units, and compounds with319
zero or undefined biological activity values. After filtering, the resulting curated datasets contained320
the following number of ligands:321
• Ki-based datasets: 356 (4WNV), 422 (4K7A), 193 (1ERE), 64 (1TQN).322
• IC50-based datasets: 1971 (4WNV), 1512 (4K7A), 2080 (1ERE), 298 (1TQN).323
These dataset sizes reflect the expected difference in coverage between Ki and IC50 data, with the324
latter being more abundant in public repositories. The curated ligand collections were subsequently325
used as the basis for docking and correlation analyses reported in the main text.
